#VBA Challenge

*This script loops through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* There is also conditional formatting that will highlight positive changes (in the yearly change) in green and negative change in red.

* This solution also returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". 

* The VBA script runs on every worksheet in a workbook, just by running the VBA script once.
